# DSPFP

This is a Python implementation of the Doubly Stochastic Projected
Fixed Point (DSPFP) algorithm for the approximate solution of the
Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) / Graph Matching (GM). the DSPFP
was proposed in:

Yao Lu, Kaizhu Huang, and Cheng-Lin Liu. Doubly stochastic projected
Fixed-Point algorithm for large graph matching. Pattern Recognition,
July 2016.
